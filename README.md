## *Information about the files in this repository* 
The learning_php.php file contains notes taken while watching the video and is a good resource to get back to when I forgot how to do something in PHP.
The surrounding files are part of the learning_php.php file:
- testing_php_code.php (file used to test the code in learning_php.php while learning)
- article-header.php
- footer.html
- header.html
- useful_tools.php

The folder ***programs*** contains short programs I was able to write after viewing the video.
